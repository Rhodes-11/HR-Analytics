# HR Analytics - Predicting Employee Attrition

This project analyzes employee data to predict attrition using machine learning models and provides insights to reduce future resignations.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
- Identify key factors contributing to employee attrition.
- Build classification models to predict future attrition.
- Visualize attrition insights using Power BI.
- Recommend strategies to improve employee retention.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `logistic_report.csv`: Classification report of logistic regression model.
- `decision_tree_report.csv`: Classification report of decision tree model.
- `Project_Report.txt`: 2-page summary report of the project.
- `Attrition_Prevention_Suggestions.txt`: Strategic recommendations to prevent attrition.

## ðŸ“ˆ Steps Followed
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Classification Modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
4. Evaluation using confusion matrix and metrics
5. Visual Insight Dashboard (Power BI)
6. SHAP/ELI5 for interpretability (optional)

## âœ… Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~83%
- Decision Tree Accuracy: ~79%
- Key Attrition Drivers: Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, Promotion History

## ðŸ§  Recommendations
- Conduct engagement surveys for low-satisfaction employees.
- Improve internal mobility and growth plans.
- Enhance flexibility and employee wellness programs.
